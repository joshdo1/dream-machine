Delivery Ideas: 
---------------

1. Pass the Phone Around:
- game is hosted on a single device
- each player takes turns interacting with the script by reading their part, passing
the device to the next person

implementation:
- modify script.html to include a next player button that clears the current view and presents
a new prompt for the next player
- add local session storage to ensure progress saved if browser reloads
- use javascript to manage state transitions btwn players and roles

cons:
- only works if everyone is physically together
-----------------------------
2. Text Everyone a Link:
- each player gets personalized link to specific portion of the script via SMS
- each player interacts with their part of the script independently

implementation:
- use vonage library to send sms messages with unique urls for each player
- generate urls dynamically in the backend --> link segments of the script
stored on the server
- modify generate-and-send endpoint in backend to splot the script into sections
and to distribute them

cons:
- all players need phone numbers
-----------------------
3. Email Distribution
- each player receives their part of the script via email including instructions
and character descriptions

implementation:
- use library like smtplib or third-party (SendGrid)
- include an input form for player emails in index.html
- split the script by player and email corresponding part

cons:
- not as immediate or interactive as the other options
-------------------------
4. Browser-Based Individual Delivery
- generate qr code using qrcode.js linking to /player-join
- players scan qr codee and input their phone number or email on/player-join page
- backend splits script by player roles and associates lines with player IDs 
- Players visit /player-lines where lines are fetched sequentiall using
/get-next-line API
- players see only their lines on screen one at a time --> clicking next sends 
a rquest to the backend to display the next player's line on their screen

backend logic:
- assign roles and aprts of the script during player registration
- ensure players can only access their assigned lines
